# Chronic kidney disease (CKD) prediction model

### Purpose
This model aims to predict whether a patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on various data gathered from clinical history, examinations, and laboratory findings.

#### Inspiration
As a doctor working in the Polonnaruwa district of Sri Lanka, I have observed that the prevalence of CKD in this area is alarmingly high, in some hotspots reaching approximately 22.9% of the population. (https://doaj.org/article/9e1d2d9528464fcea616fe02c845841b)
