# Chronic kidney disease (CKD) prediction model

### Purpose
This model aims to predict whether a patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on various data gathered from clinical history, examinations, and laboratory findings.

#### Inspiration
As a doctor working in the Polonnaruwa district of Sri Lanka, I have observed that the prevalence of CKD in this area is alarmingly high. Which is often obsered through various reaseach. (https://doaj.org/article/9e1d2d9528464fcea616fe02c845841b)  
I aspire to develop a machine learning model that can be deployed online to accurately predict whether a patient has CKD. This model is designed to identify patients in the early stages of CKD and guide them toward treatment before they progress to end-stage renal failure.

### Data source
Data used for model training is taken from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

### Trained model
best model among the trained models was a Random Forrest Classifier model. You can find more information regarding the steps of the model training on this Jupyter Notebook.
